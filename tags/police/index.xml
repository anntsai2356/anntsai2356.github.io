Merseyside Police said those arrested were being held “on suspicion of violent disorder and taken to police stations to be questioned.”
The protest, sparked by a video filmed near the hotel, had started peacefully, police said, but the situation later became tense and projectiles were thrown at the officers.</description></item></channel></rss>
